# MySql-With-PHP

This class was written with the intention of interacting with PHP and MySql.
The server runs PHP as the backend language and MySql as the database.
This class is designed primarily to interface with Stored Procedures, but can be used to make simple queries as well.
This has already been used in some projects and therefore is working well.
Feel free to ask any questions.
